  "body": "# Product Cataloging and intelligence\r\n\r\nProduct comparison sites scrape data from various e-commerce websites and provide user with a one-stop pricing details page. The goal is to similarly build a product database, extract vendor pricing information and perform analytics over the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Main system\r\nThe main system consists of the following modules :\r\n\r\n1. Master catalogue development (Scrape)  \r\n2. Product dump extraction\r\n3. Vendor dump extraction\r\n4. Price dump extraction\r\n5. Product pricing sensitivity analysis\r\n6. Product master creation\r\n7. Intelligence to avoid screen scraping blockages\r\n8. HTML GUI query interface along with the required backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @manglakaran a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
